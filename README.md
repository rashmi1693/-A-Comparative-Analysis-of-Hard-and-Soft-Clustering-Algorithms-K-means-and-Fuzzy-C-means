# Comparative-Analysis-of-Hard-and-Soft-Clustering
K-Means or Hard C-Means clustering is basically a partitioning method applied to analyze data and treats observations of the data as objects based on locations and distance between various input data points. FCM is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that is applied to a wide range of problems connected with feature analysis, clustering and classifier design. K-means algorithm is more efficient than Fuzzy C-means algorithm in dataset segmentation while FCM performs better in image segmentation.
